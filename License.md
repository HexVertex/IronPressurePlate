You are allowed to use parts of this mod's
code to learn and use in your own mods.

if this mod isn't updated to the current
version of minecraft yet you are allowed to
update it. if you do so you have to add a link
to the [XEliteZ main thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/842232-) and you have to notify
kalvin(the mod creator) of what you're up to. 
shortening the URL is not allowed for both 
the download and the link to the main thread. 
This also applies for bukkit ports but if you create a
port you have to notify [Kalvin](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/637707-) on the minecraftforums
that you've made a port and it may only be uploaded to
mcportcentral.co.za after Kalvin has send a personal
confirmation. Keep in mind that I will notify you back
if I've made or will make my own port and that you
are not allowed to update the port anymore unless
you've been given permission to do so.

you are not allowed to make a mod that copies
too much code without giving any credit to this.

You are allowed to use this mod in youtube videos
and series and other things as long as you leave
a link to the XEliteZ thread somewhere.

thanks for reading this license and I hope you have
fun with the mod.
