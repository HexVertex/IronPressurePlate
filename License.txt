You are allowed to use parts of this mod's
code to learn and use in your own mods.

if this mod isn't updated to the current
version of minecraft yet you are allowed to
update it. if you do so you have to add a link
to the XEliteZ main thread and you have to notify
kalvin(the mod creator) of what you're up to. 
shortening the URL is not allowed for both 
the download and the link to the main thread. 

you are not allowed to make a mod that copies
too much code without giving any credit to this.

You are allowed to use this mod in youtube videos
and series and other things as long as you leave
a link to the XEliteZ thread somewhere.

thanks for reading this license and I hope you have
fun with the mod.
